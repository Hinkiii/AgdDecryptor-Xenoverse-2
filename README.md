## Information
This is a reupload of a tool from the XeNTaX Forums used to decrypt and convert Dragon Ball Xenoverse 2 .agd files to .xml and back again.
Source code has been included as it was uploaded. This is not my original work, however, I am unable to attribute the original author as the original post/tool was deleted from the Forum around 2017/2018.

XeNTaX has also since been shutdown.

## How to Use
Use [CriPakTools](https://github.com/esperknight/CriPakTools) to extract/unpack files in .cpk format.
AgdDecryptor can now be used to convert any .agd files to .xml and back again, such as avatar_growth_data.agd.
